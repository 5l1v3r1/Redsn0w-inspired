# Redsn0w-inspired
Redsn0w Inspired is a Gui for checkm8 that gives you a bit of a nastalgic feeling.

# What it can do
 1. Standard Demote, dump securerom and enter Pwndfu mode.
 2. Verbose boot on iPhone X. iOS 12.2, 13.1.1, and 13.1.2
 3. Alloc8 and uninstall alloc8
 4. Exit recovery mode (Needed it for personal use)
 Soon: I'm currently working on a downgrade to 10.3.3 button for A7 devices.
 
# Important
In order for Redsn0w Inspired to work properly, please put it in applications. (I cd into "applications" to get into iPwndfu's folder)

I plan to add more eventually but don't have much time with school in the way. Updates will hopefully come every weekend. Whether their small or an important one.

I will make it open source soon however, i'm using this as a learning experience. If you have a suggestion or found a bug, please contact me via Twitter. @LamotheColby
